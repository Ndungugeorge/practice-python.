Function: island_perimeter(grid)
Returns the perimeter of the island described in the grid.

Parameters:
grid (list of list of integers): Represents the grid where:
    - 0 represents a water zone
    - 1 represents a land zone

Returns:
int: The perimeter of the island

Assumptions:
- One cell is a square with side length 1
- Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).
- Grid is rectangular, width and height don’t exceed 100
- Grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is one island (or nothing).
- The island doesn’t have “lakes” (water inside that isn’t connected to the water around the island).
